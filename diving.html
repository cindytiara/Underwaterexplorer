                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Plan the dive:</h3>
                    <p>Planning the dive is very important, such as the time spent underwater, the air limit in the cylinder, depth of the dive, and other plans. Plan a safety stop before ending the dive for three minutes or more.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Maintain neutral buoyancy:</h3>
                    <p>Adjust weight at the surface for neutral buoyancy. Maintain neutral buoyancy while underwater. Use appropriate weights to facilitate neutral buoyancy.</p>
